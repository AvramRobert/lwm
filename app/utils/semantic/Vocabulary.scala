      * Status: 	stable
      * Properties include: 	member
      * Subclass Of 	Agent
      *
      * The Group class represents a collection of individual agents (and may itself play the role of a Agent, ie.
      * something that can perform actions).
      *
      * This concept is intentionally quite broad, covering informal and ad-hoc groups, long-lived communities,
      * organizational groups within a workplace, etc. Some such groups may have associated characteristics which could
      * be captured in RDF (perhaps a homepage, name, mailing list etc.).
      *
      * While a Group has the characteristics of a Agent, it is also associated with a number of other Agents
      * (typically people) who constitute the Group. FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which
      * relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated,
      * but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.
      *
      * The markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules
      * to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar
      * vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for
      * categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.
      *
      * While the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for
      * saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate
      * the agents that are members of the group. For example:
      *
      *
      * <foaf:Group>
      * <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>
      * <foaf:member>
      * <foaf:Person>
      * <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>
      * <foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp"/>
      * <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/"/>
      * </foaf:Person>
      * </foaf:member>
      * </foaf:Group>
      *
      * Behind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group.
      * End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.
      *
      * Here is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members
      * (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group
      * (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who
      * constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in
      * turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/.
      * This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be
      * a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this,
      * we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must
      * be true of matching agents.
      *
      * <!-- here we see a FOAF group described.
      * each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition
      * specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->
      * <foaf:Group>
      * <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>
      * <foaf:membershipClass>
      * <owl:Class rdf:about="http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson">
      * <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"/>
      * <rdfs:subClassOf>
      * <owl:Restriction>
      * <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage"/>
      * <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/"/>
      * </owl:Restriction>
      * </rdfs:subClassOf>
      * </owl:Class>
      * </foaf:membershipClass>
      * </foaf:Group>
      *
      * Note that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having
      * a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include
      * this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is
      * an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group
      * whose name is "ILRT staff", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words,
      * generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.
      *
      * The current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when
      * writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of
      * the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to
      * nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:
      *
      * <foaf:Group>
      * <foaf:member rdf:nodeID="martin"/>
      * <!-- more about the group here -->
      * </foaf:Group>
      * <foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="martin">
      * <!-- more about martin here -->
      * </foaf:Person>
      *
      * There is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL
      * language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and
      * datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is
      * solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?

      * PersonalProfileDocument - A personal profile RDF document.
      * Status: 	testing

      *
      * The PersonalProfileDocument class represents those things that are a Document, and that use RDF to describe properties
      * of the person who is the maker of the document. There is just one Person described in the document, ie. the person
      * who made it and who will be its primaryTopic.
      *
      * The PersonalProfileDocument class, and FOAF's associated conventions for describing it, captures an important
      * deployment pattern for the FOAF vocabulary. FOAF is very often used in public RDF documents made available
      * through the Web. There is a colloquial notion that these "FOAF files" are often somebody's FOAF file.
      * Through PersonalProfileDocument we provide a machine-readable expression of this concept, providing a basis
      * for FOAF documents to make claims about their maker and topic.
      *
      * When describing a PersonalProfileDocument it is typical (and useful) to describe its associated Person using the maker
      * property. Anything that is a Person and that is the maker of some PersonalProfileDocument will be the primaryTopic
      * of that Document. Although this can be inferred, it is often helpful to include this information explicitly within
      * the PersonalProfileDocument.
      *
      * For example, here is a fragment of a personal profile document which describes its author explicitly:
      *
      * <foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="p1">
      * <foaf:name>Dan Brickley</foaf:name>
      * <foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://danbri.org/"/>

      * <foaf:maker rdf:nodeID="p1"/>
      * <foaf:primaryTopic rdf:nodeID="p1"/>
      * </foaf:PersonalProfileDocument>
      *
      * Note that a PersonalProfileDocument will have some representation as RDF. Typically this will be in W3C's RDF/XML
      * syntax, however we leave open the possibility for the use of other notations, or representational conventions
      * including automated transformations from HTML (GRDDL spec for one such technique).

      * Subclass Of 	Online Account
      *
      * A OnlineChatAccount is a OnlineAccount devoted to chat / instant messaging. The account may offer other services too;
      * FOAF's sub-classes of OnlineAccount are not mutually disjoint.
      *
      * This is a generalization of the FOAF Chat ID properties, jabberID, aimChatID, skypeID, msnChatID, icqChatID and yahooChatID.
      *
      * Unlike those simple properties, OnlineAccount and associated FOAF terms allows us to describe a great variety of online
      * accounts, without having to anticipate them in the FOAF vocabulary.
      *
      * For example, here is a description of an IRC chat account, specific to the Freenode IRC network:
      *
      * <foaf:Person>
      * <foaf:name>Dan Brickley</foaf:name>
      * <foaf:account>
      * <foaf:OnlineAccount>
      * <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/OnlineChatAccount"/>
      * <foaf:accountServiceHomepage
      * rdf:resource="http://www.freenode.net/"/>
      * <foaf:accountName>danbri</foaf:accountName>
      * </foaf:OnlineAccount>
      * </foaf:account>
      * </foaf:Person>
      *
      * Note that it may be impolite to carelessly reveal someone else's chat identifier (which might also serve as an indicate
      * of email address) As with email, there are privacy and anti-SPAM considerations. FOAF does not currently provide a
      * way to represent an obfuscated chat ID (ie. there is no parallel to the mbox / mbox_sha1sum mapping).
      *
      * In addition to the generic OnlineAccount and OnlineChatAccount mechanisms, FOAF also provides several convenience chat
      * ID properties (jabberID, aimChatID, icqChatID, msnChatID,yahooChatID, skypeID). These serve as as a shorthand for
      * some common cases; their use may not always be appropriate.
      *
      * We should specify some mappings between the abbreviated and full representations of Jabber, AIM, MSN, ICQ, Yahoo! and
      * MSN chat accounts. This has been done for skypeID. This requires us to identify an appropriate accountServiceHomepage
      * for each. If we wanted to make the OnlineAccount mechanism even more generic, we could invent a relationship that
      * holds between a OnlineAccount instance and a convenience property. To continue the example above, we could describe
      * how Freenode could define a property 'fn:freenodeChatID' corresponding to Freenode online accounts.

      * The knows property relates a Person to another Person that he or she knows.
      *
      * We take a broad view of 'knows', but do require some form of reciprocated interaction (ie. stalkers need not apply).
      * Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is
      * not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.
      *
      * If someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there
      * is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply
      * friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all
      * perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.
      *
      * You probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list
      * them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic
      * Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said,
      * more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).
      *
      * Since knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF
      * properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you "knows".
      * Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people
      * you know.
      *
      * To provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.
      *
      * They can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of
      * these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate a
      * ir of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's
      * Relationship module for FOAF.
      *
      * In addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as
      * good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example,
      * two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently)
      * clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if
      * there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind.
      * Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.
      *
      * So FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a
      * general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any
      * kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate
      * ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.
      *
      * Perhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken
      * alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with
      * each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows
      * or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing
      * tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they
      * mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory
      * of FOAF files...

      * are mentioned in different SKOS schemes (eg. thesauri).
      *
      * W3C SKOS is based around collections of linked 'concepts', which indicate topics, subject areas and categories. In SKOS,
      * properties of a skos:Concept are properties of the conceptualization (see 2005 discussion for details); for example
      * administrative and record-keeping metadata. Two schemes might have an entry for the same individual; the foaf:focus
      * property can be used to indicate the thing in they world that they both focus on. Many SKOS concepts don't work this
      * way; broad topical areas and subject categories don't typically correspond to some particular entity. However, in
      * cases when they do, it is useful to link both subject-oriented and thing-oriented information via foaf:focus.
      *
      * FOAF's focus property works alongside its other topic-oriented constructs: topic, primaryTopic are used when talking
      * about the topical emphasis of a document. The notion of primaryTopic is particularly important in FOAF as it
      * provides an indirect mechanism for identifying things indirectly. A similar approach is explored by the TDB URI

      * Status: 	testing
      * Domain: 	having this property implies being a Agent
      * Functional Property
      *
      * The gender property relates a Agent (typically a Person) to a string representing its gender. In most cases the value
      * will be the string 'female' or 'male' (in lowercase without surrounding quotes or spaces). Like all FOAF properties,
      * there is in general no requirement to use gender in any particular document or description. Values other than
      * 'male' and 'female' may be used, but are not enumerated here. The gender mechanism is not intended to capture the
      * full variety of biological, social and sexual concepts associated with the word 'gender'.
      *
      * Anything that has a gender property will be some kind of Agent. However there are kinds of Agent to which the concept
      * of gender isn't applicable (eg. a Group). FOAF does not currently include a class corresponding directly to
      * "the type of thing that has a gender". At any point in time, a Agent has at most one value for gender. FOAF does
      * not treat gender as a static property; the same individual may have different values for this property at different
      * times.
      *
      * Note that FOAF's notion of gender isn't defined biologically or anatomically - this would be tricky since we have a broad
      * notion that applies to all Agents (including robots - eg. Bender from Futurama is 'male'). As stressed above, FOAF's
      * notion of gender doesn't attempt to encompass the full range of concepts associated with human gender, biology and
      * sexuality. As such it is a (perhaps awkward) compromise between the clinical and the social/psychological. In general,
      * a person will be the best authority on their gender. Feedback on this design is particularly welcome (via the FOAF
      * mailing list, foaf-dev). We have tried to be respectful of diversity without attempting to catalogue or enumerate that
      * diversity.
      *
      * This may also be a good point for a periodic reminder: as with all FOAF properties, documents that use 'gender' will
      * on occassion be innacurate, misleading or outright false. FOAF, like all open means of communication, supports lying.
      * Application authors using FOAF data should always be cautious in their presentation of unverified information, but
      * be particularly sensitive to issues and risks surrounding sex and gender (including privacy and personal safety concerns).
      * Designers of FOAF-based user interfaces should be careful to allow users to omit gender when describing themselves
      * and others, and to allow at least for values other than 'male' and 'female' as options. Users of information conveyed
      * via FOAF (as via information conveyed through mobile phone text messages, email, Internet chat, HTML pages etc.)

      * to help find answers to questions such as "Find me members of this organisation with an interest in XML who have

      * files of those who choose to include it. The myersBriggs property applies only to the Person class; wherever you
      * see it, you can infer it is being applied to a person.
      *
      * The myersBriggs property is interesting in that it illustrates how FOAF can serve as a carrier for various kinds of
      * information, without necessarily being commited to any associated worldview. Not everyone will find myersBriggs
      * (or star signs, or blood types, or the four humours) a useful perspective on human behaviour and personality. The
      * inclusion of a Myers Briggs property doesn't indicate that FOAF endorses the underlying theory, any more than the
      * existence of weblog is an endorsement of soapboxes.
      *
      * The values for myersBriggs are the following 16 4-letter textual codes: ESTJ, INFP, ESFP, INTJ, ESFJ, INTP, ENFP, ISTJ,
      * ESTP, INFJ, ENFJ, ISTP, ENTJ, ISFP, ENTP, ISFJ. If multiple of these properties are applicable, they are represented
      * by applying multiple properties to a person.
      *
      * For further reading on MBTI, see various online sources (eg. this article). There are various online sites which offer
      * quiz-based tools for determining a person's MBTI classification. The owners of the MBTI trademark have probably not
      * approved of these.
      *
      * This FOAF property suggests some interesting uses, some of which could perhaps be used to test the claims made by
      * proponents of the MBTI (eg. an analysis of weblog postings filtered by MBTI type). However it should be noted that
      * MBTI FOAF descriptions are self-selecting; MBTI categories may not be uniformly appealing to the people they
